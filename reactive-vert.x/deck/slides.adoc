[.statement]
`Objective:` +
Learn how to build _reactive_ applications using functional programming with _Vert.x_

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* The aim of today's presentation is ...
* ... to learn how to build reactive applications using functional programming with Vert.x
* To build reactive applications ...
* ... we need to apply a set of patterns that are commonly known as Reactive Programming
====

[.topic.intro]
== What is *Reactive* Programming?

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* So, what is Rective Programming?
* Reactive programming describes ...
* ... a set of programming patterns and techniques
* ... that have become increasingly important over last few years
====

[.topic.source]
== Requirements 10 Years Ago

====
* -- _10s_ of Servers
* -- Response time in _seconds_
* -- Maintenance window of _hours_
* -- Data volume in _GBs_
====

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Reactive programming has become important because of changing requirements
* 10 years ago, a large installation would have 10s of servers
* Response times measured in seconds
* ~2 hours maintenance times
* Data volumes measured in `GB`
====

[.topic.source]
== Requirements Nowadays

====
* -- _1000s_ of Servers
* -- Response time in _milliseconds_
* -- _No_ maintenance window
* -- Data volume in _TBs_, even _PBs_
====

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Nowadays, a large or cloud installation would have 1000s of nodes
* Users expect `millisecond` response times
* There should be no downtime with 24/7 availability
* Data volumes are in TBs and sometimes even reaching `PB`s
* Initially, domain of innovative, internet-driven, companies like Google or Twitter
* But demands appearing in other industries, first finance/telco, now others following
====

== !

[.statement]
New requirements need +
*new architectures*

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* These new requirements need new architectures that can satisfy the needs
====

== !

[.statement]
Classic architectures of +
_managed servers_ or containers,
_not ready_ for these new requirements

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* The classic architecture is the Java Enterprise Server ...
* ... consisting of managed servers and application containers
* Scaling was done buying large servers ...
* ... or clustering of big servers was complex and often used expensive/propietary solutions
====

== !

[.statement]
We need *Reactive applications!*

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* What we need is reactive applications!
====

[.topic.source]
== Reactive Applications

====
* -- are _event-driven_
* -- are _scalable_
* -- are _resilient_
* -- are _responsive_
====

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Reactive applications present several characteristics:
* ... are event-driven
* ... are scalable
* ... are resilient
* ... are responsive
====

== !

"reactive : +
readily responsive to a stimulus"
-- Merriam-Webster

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Merriam-Webster deﬁnes reactive as _readily responsive to a stimulus_,
* iow, its components are “active” and always ready to receive events
====

[.topic.source]
== Readily responsive to a stimulus

====
* -- React to events (_event-driven_)
* -- React to load (_scalable_)
* -- React to failures (_resilient_)
* -- React to users (_responsive_)
====

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* In the world of software, a system is reactive when:
* It can react to events, so it's event-driven
* It can react to changing amounts of load, so it's scalable
* It can react to failures, so it's resilient
* It should react to its users, so it's responsive
====

[.topic.source]
== The Reactive Traits

image::full-reactive.png[]

.source
....
reactivemanifesto.org/images/full-reactive.png
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Being event-driven is a technical property ...
* ... that enables the properties of being scalable and resilient
* All three properties together enable systems that are responsive
====

[.topic.source]
== Non Event-Driven

Before, systems composed of multiple threads, +
communicating via shared mutable state +
-> _strong coupling_ and _hard to compose_ +

image::chains.jpg[width=240]
....
flickr.com/photos/althewebmaster/532160680
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Let's start analyzing what event-driven means
* Up until now, a lot of concurrent systems ...
* ... have been constructed using multiple threads which communicated via shared, mutable, state
* This lead to high degree of coupling and also such systems were hard to compose
====

[.topic.source]
== Event-Driven

Systems composed of _loosely coupled_ event handlers, +
communicating via _asynchronous events_, +
without blocking!

image::loosely-coupled.jpg[width=240]
....
flickr.com/photos/bru/129437516
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Event-driven systems are composed from loosely coupled event handlers
* Events in such system can be handled asynchronously and they do not incur any blocking!
* And because there's no blocking, resources can be utilised much more efficiently
====

[.topic.source]
== Scalable

An application is _scalable_ when it can handle increased load without
affecting its usability

image::scalable.jpg[width=320]
....
flickr.com/photos/ybite/1094585685
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* An application is scalable if the application can be expanded according to its usage
* Underground transport systems should be scalable ...
* ... but there are some notable exceptions, such as the Tube in London ;)
* Typically we distinguish two directions of scaling:
====

[.topic.source]
== Scala Up

Use paralellism in _multi-core_ systems +
to handle load increases +

To scale up efficiently, +
_shared mutable state_ must be _minimised_

image::multi-core.jpg[width=240]
....
flickr.com/photos/viagallery/6925196395
....


[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* scale-up uses paralellism in multi-core systems ...
* ... which are more and more common in computers today
* Importance for scale up is minimise shared mutable state ...
* ... since it impacts the ease or efficiency of scaling
====

[.topic.source]
== Scala Out

Use of _multiple server nodes_ +
to handle load increases +

To scale out easily, _location transparency_ required +
to remove dependency on node location

image::server-farm.jpg[width=200]
....
flickr.com/photos/mrfaber/247946146
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* scale-out uses multiple nodes, often in the same data centre
* Importance for scale out is the property of _location transparency_
* It should not matter where a node is located...
* ... it could be on same computer, or in the internet, the functionality should remain the same
====

[.topic.source]
== Resilient

An application is _resilient_ when it can recover quickly from failures, i.e.
SW/HW/network failures

image::software-failure.jpg[width=320]
....
flickr.com/photos/74157931@N00/4005857555
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* An application is resilient if it can recover quickly from failures
* Failures could be software failures, such as throwing an exception
* Or hardware failures, computer going down
* Or connection failures, internet/network connection going down
====

[.topic.source]
== Resilient

_Resilience_ cannot be an afterthought, +
it needs to be part of the design from the beginning

image::afterthought.jpg[width=240]
....
flickr.com/photos/genista/10127708
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Resilience cannot be added as an afterthought, needs to be part of the design from the beginning
* With application servers, most people start with a single node
* When things start to fail, they add clustering, but it's often too late to do so ...
* ... since it often requires a re-thinking of the application
====

[.topic.source]
== Resilient

Resilient systems need: +
-> _Loosely coupled_ components +
-> Strong _encapsulation of state_ +
-> Pervasive _supervisor_ hierarchies +
-> _Failover_ via scalability +

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Important techniques for building resilient systems are:
* Keeping your components loose coupled
* Having a strong encapsulation of mutable state
* Having pervasive supervisor hierarchies
* Finally, being scalable gives you multiple nodes, so they can fail and
the system has to cope with that
====

[.topic.source]
== Responsive

An application is _responsive_ if it provides a rich, enganging, collaborative,
_real-time interaction_ with its users, _regardless of load or failures_

Being event-driven, scalable and resilient help applications be responsive,
but...

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Finally, an application is responsive if it ...
* ... provides a rich, real-time interaction with its users even under load and in the presence of failures
* Responsive applications can be built on an event-driven, scalable, and resilient architecture
====

[.topic.source]
== Keeping It Responsive

Need to pay careful attention to +
system design, algorithms used, back-pressure...etc

i.e. If any layer _blocks_, even consumption can stall, +
_increasing latency_ and _reducing scalability_ :(((

image::frustration.jpg[width=200]
....
flickr.com/photos/evilerin/3796279865
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* That doesn't automatically lead to a responsive application
* You still need to pay careful attention to algorithms, SW designs, back-pressure, etc
* But, being event-driven, scalable and resilient are important, ...
* ... even necessary building blocks, to arrive to a responsive application
* If any of the layers makes blocking calls ...
* the event consumption stalls and it leads to increased latency and reduced scalability

`Objective:` +
Learn how to build _reactive_ applications using functional programming with _Vert.x_

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Let's go back to the objective of today's presentation
* We now know what an reactive application is and its key attributes
* Next, we are going to see what is Vert.x
* and how to build reactive applications with Vert.x
====

[.topic.intro]
== What is *Vert.x*?

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* So, what is Vert.x?
====

== !

[.statement]
Vert.x is a _polyglot_ application _development_ framework for the JVM
enabling you to build _reactive applications_

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* A polyglot application development framework
* Promotes development of applications written in a Reactive Programming style
====

[.topic.source]
== Vert.x

====
* -- is _event-driven_
* -- is _scalable_
* -- is _resilient_
* -- enables _responsive_ applications
====

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Vert.x is event-driven
* Vert.x is scalable
* Vert.x is resilient
* Vert.x enables responsive applications
* Let's look at each of these attributes individually
====

[.topic.source]
== Vert.x is Event-Driven

The unit of execution is a _Verticle_ +
which _reacts to event messages_, +
and communicates _sending event messages_

image::event-driven.jpg[width=240]
....
flickr.com/photos/behind-the-lense/3350188796
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Vert.x provides an event-driven programming style
* In Vert.x, verticles are the execution unit of Vert.x
* Verticles react to event messages
* Verticles communicate with other verticles via event message passing
====

[.topic.source]
== Single Threaded Verticles

_Verticles_ consume events one at the time, +
and they are _single threaded_, +
so you _can keep mutable state_ inside the Verticle

image::queue.jpg[width=240]
....
flickr.com/photos/hktang/4243300265
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Executed by a single thread at the time
* You can keep mutable state at the Verticle level ...
* ... with the knowledge that you don't need to worry about concurrency
* IOW, you can keep a hash map, a linked list, instead of a CHM or CopyOnWriteArrayList
====

[.topic.source]
== Java Verticle demo

[source,java]
.+HelloWorld.java+
----
import org.vertx.java.core.Handler;
import org.vertx.java.core.http.HttpServerRequest;
import org.vertx.java.platform.Verticle;

public class HelloWorld extends Verticle {
  public void start() {
    vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(new Handler<HttpServerRequest>() { <1>
      public void handle(HttpServerRequest req) {
        req.response().end("<body><h1>Hello World from Java!</h1></body>"); <2>
      }
    }).listen(8080);
  }
}
----
<1> Create an HTTP server, add a request event handler
<2> Reply with the same message to all incoming requests

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Event handling not new, event handling traditionally done using call-backs
* Here's an example of a Java Verticle
* Creates an HTTP server that listens in port 8080 and adds a request handler
* Reply with the same message to all incoming requests
* Let's run this demo -> Go to `Terminal`
====

[.topic.source]
== Event-Driven, The Functional Way

Functional style better for _event-driven_ systems +
_Scala_ is a great language to write Vert.x apps, +
the _functional_ way

image::scala.png[width=120]

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Dealing with call-backs in the imperative way is bulky
* Functional programming style more suited for event-driven systems
* Scala offers a mature, established way, to do FP today, without waiting for Java8
* It runs on the JVM, as a normal library, and has excellent support in all major IDEs
====

[.topic.source]
== Scala Verticle Demo

[source,scala]
.+HelloWorld.scala+
----
vertx.createHttpServer.requestHandler { req: HttpServerRequest => <1>
  req.response.end("Hello World from Scala!") <2>
}.listen(8080)
----

<1> Create an HTTP server, passes a function to execute for each request
<2> Reply with the same message to all incoming requests

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Here's a Scala version of the previous Hello World verticle
* Much less verbose, and function passing works much better here
* A similar thing might be doable with Java 8, but Scala's offering goes well beyond just passing functions
* A key aspect of functional programming is composability: _Do this with event, then do this..._
* In Java, this will be done adding callbacks after callbacks
* Scala offers nice syntatic sugar to make dealing with callbacks more bearable :)
* Example not ready yet, but as soon as we have 1-to-1 mapping with Java API, we'll start working on it :)
* Let's run this demo -> Go to `Terminal`
====

image:clojure.gif[width=128] image:php.png[width=232]


[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Apart from Scala and Java, Vert.x offers language extensions in other languages
* Some allow more functional styles than others
* Some are statically typed and others dynamically typed
* So, no matter what you preferences are, Vert.x's got you covered!
====

[.topic.source]
== Vert.x is Scalable

Verticles can communicate in-VM or inter-VM +
regardless, they communicate the same way +
providing _location transparency_

image::location-transparency.jpg[width=240]
....
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Teliris_VL_Executive.jpg
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Vert.x not only supports verticles talking to each in other in the same JVM ...
* ... but it allows them to be in different places in the network
* Regardless where they are, you communicate with them in the same way
* Gives you _'location transparency'_, which is a key characteristic of scalable applications
* To enable this, the event bus which carries the events can be clustered
====

[.topic.source]
== Enabling Real-Time Web Applications

Vert.x enables building _real-time_ web apps +
where verticles talk to _Javascript_ clients +
such as _HTTP browsers_

image::real-time.jpg[width=240]
....
flickr.com/photos/31029865@N06/6646814881
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Vert.x Scalability is key for building "real-time" web applications
* Because you can also develop verticles client side, written in Javascript
* This way you can build very responsive web applications ...
* ... where data is pushed from the server to the client
* Client side, use whatever toolkit you want: AngularJS, straight JQuery...etc
====

[.topic.source]
== Scalability Demo- Receiver

[source,js]
.+receiver.js+
----
var eb = require("vertx/event_bus");
var console = require("vertx/console");

eb.registerHandler("news-feed", function(message) { <1>
  console.log('Received news: ' + message); <2>
});
----

<1> Javascript verticle subscribes to a news feed
<2> When a news message is received, it prints it to the console

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* This demo is going to demonstrate the scalability of Vert.x
* This is a Javascript verticle that subscribes to a news feed
* When a news message is received, it prints it to the console
* Let's run this demo -> Go to `Terminal`
====

[.topic.source]
== Scalability Demo - Sender

[source,scala]
.+Sender.scala+
----
vertx.setPeriodic(1000, { timerID => <1>
  vertx.eventBus.publish("news-feed", "News from Scala!") <2>
})
----

<1> Register a periodic function to execute every second
<2> The function sends a String message

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* This is Scala sender which registers a function to be executed every second
* This function sends a message to the news feed
* Let's run it -> Go to `Terminal`
====

[.topic.source]
== Scalability Demo - Bridge Server

[source,js]
.+bridge_server.js+
----
var vertx = require('vertx')

var server = vertx.createHttpServer()

server.requestHandler(function(req) {
  var file = req.path() === '/' ? 'index.html' : req.path() <1>
  req.response.sendFile("./" + file)
})

vertx.createSockJSServer(server).bridge({prefix: "/eventbus"}, [{}], [{}]) <2>

server.listen(8080)
----

<1> Serve the static resources, `/` is mapped to `index.html`
<2> Create a SockJS bridge which lets everything through (be careful!)

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* In the final part of the scalability demo, we're going to take the scalability one step further
* We're going to show how to get those events propagated to the client side
* For that, we need a bridge server to push the messages via SockJs
* Sockjs is an abstraction over WebSockets ...
* ... that allows WebSockets-like behaviour even in browsers that do not support WebSockets
* Sockjs bridges client-side event bus with server-side event bus
====


[.topic.source]
== Scalability Demo - Browser

[source,html]
.+index.html+
----
<html>
... <1>
<div id="status"></div> <2>
<script>
  var eb = new vertx.EventBus("http://localhost:8080/eventbus");
  eb.onopen = function() {
    eb.registerHandler("news-feed", function(msg) { <3>
      var str = "<code>" + msg + "</code><br>";
      $('#status').prepend(str);
    })
  }
</script></html>
----

<1> Add `jquery`, `sockjs` and `vertxbus` script libraries
<2> Holder HTML where events will be written
<3> Register a handler and update the `status` whenever a message is received

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* This is a shortened version of the index.html file
* It uses `jquery`, `sockjs` and `vertbux` javascript libraries to receive events
* The javascript in the HTML registers a handler for the `news-feed`
* When a message is received, it adds it to the `status` HTML holder
* Let's run this demo -> Go to `Terminal`
====

[.topic.source]
== Vert.x is Resilient

With _automatic failover_ of Vert.x modules, +
_applications continue working_ in presence of failures +

image::deviation.jpg[width=240]
....
flickr.com/photos/zigazou76/6312586663
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Vert.x applications can continue working even in the presence of one or more parts failing
* The way Vert.x currently supports it is by having automatic failover of deployed modules
* Vert.x modules encapsulate code and resources of your application
* You can have multiple modules in your application
* You can have your modules running in a server and if you have more than one node...
* ... another node will take responsibility for those modules
====

[.topic.source]
== Resilience Demo - Groovy Sender

[source,groovy]
.+Sender.groovy+
----
def eb = vertx.eventBus
vertx.setPeriodic(1000) { <1>
  eb.publish("news-feed", "News from Groovy!") <2>
}
----

<1> Execute a function peridically (1 second)
<2> Function publishes an event to `news-feed` subscription

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* For the resilience demo, we are going to use two senders:
* The first one written in Groovy
* Groovy is a dynamically typed language, very similar to Java
* -> Go to `Terminal` and start the sender
====

[.topic.source]
== Resilience Demo - Python Sender

[source,python]
.+sender.py+
----
import vertx
from core.event_bus import EventBus

def timer_handler(timer_id): <1>
    EventBus.publish('news-feed', 'News fom python!')

vertx.set_periodic(1000, timer_handler) <2>
....

<1> Define a function that sends an event to the `news-feed` subscription
<2> Execute this function periodically, every 1 second

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* The second sender is a Python sender, which again, sends a message periodically
* So, we'll have two senders publishing messages, each running in a separate JVM
* -> Go to `Terminal` and start the sender, and the rest of steps...

== Vert.x enables Responsive applications

Applications should follow some _best practices_ +
to keep their _applications responsive_ +
i.e. _non-blocking_ from top to bottom!

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Vert.x enables you to write responsive applications
* On top of what Vert.x provides to make your application responsive...
* ... there are some best practices that need to be followed to make your Vert.x apps responsive
====

[.topic.source]
== Never block in Verticle!

CAUTION: `Thread.sleep()`

CAUTION: `CountDownLatch.await()` or any other blocking operation from
`java.util.concurrent`

CAUTION: `while(true) {puts "King of the world!"}`

CAUTION: Long-lived computationally intensive operations

CAUTION: Blocking operations that might take a while (e.g. DB query)

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* For an application to be responsive, it needs to be non-blocking from top to bottom
* So, never block inside a Verticle!
* If one of these layers does not participate, e.g.
** Making blocking calls to the database
** Relying on shared mutable state
** Calling out to expensive synchronous operations
* ... then the whole pipeline stalls
* ... users will suffer through increased latency and reduced scalability
====

[.topic.source]
== Keep Latency Consistent Tips

TIP: Amortize cost of expensive operations +
(e.g. IO and concurrent data exchange)

TIP: Monitor systems for appropriate capacity planning

TIP: Use bounded queues with back pressure (Little's law)

drmommyonline.com/hub/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/helpful-tips.jpg
....

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Use strategies to keep latency consistent regardless of load profile:
* Under bursty traffic conditions apps amortize the cost of expensive operations (e.g. IO, concurrent data exchange)
* ... applying batching combined w/ understanding and consideration of underlying resources to keep latency consistent
* Monitor systems for appropriate capacity planning
* Queues bounded with appropriate back pressure, queue lengths for response constraints determined employing Little’s Law
* Little's law tells you when you should start backing off
* Back pressure example: span off a different thread to deal with events until pressure has gone down

== Summary

====
An application is reactive if it:
* -- reacts to events
* -- is scalable
* -- is resilient
* -- is responsive
====

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* To finish, a summary of the talk today
* We've seen how reactive applications are those that react to events
* They are scalable, so they can expand according to load
* They are resilient, so they can cope with failure
* They are responsive, so they react to user operations promptly
====

[.topic.source]
== Summary

_Vert.x_ is a polyglot application development framework for the JVM +
promoting development of _reactive_ applications, +
which are event-driven, scalable, resilient and responsive

[NOTE]
[role="speaker"]
====
* Vert.x is a polyglot application development framework for the JVM
* It promotes development of reactive applications
* So, Vert.x applications are event-driven
* They are scalable beyond a single JVM
* They can handle failure through scalability
* They are responsive
