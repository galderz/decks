image:oscon-mascot.jpg[role="thumb right"] I'm excited to be at OSCON 2013.
I'm currently attending a workshop on collaborative documentation.
We're learning about how to:

- setup a static website with Awestruct
- compose content in AsciiDoc
- collaborate on content using git and GitHub
- publish the website to GitHub Pages
- and lots more!

In fact, this website was launched during the workshop.
----

NOTE: The default images directory is +/images+.
You don't have to include the images directory in the image path.
Asciidoctor will automatically resolve the image relative to the images directory.
This also allows you to change the location of the images directory (or URL) without needing to update your content.

== Include a block image in a post written in AsciiDoc

I can't wait to show my site to these GitHub guys.
They'll be proud ;)

CAUTION: The video macro is somewhat limited at the moment.
It can't yet handle YouTube videos.
You could use a pass through block to insert HTML directly.
